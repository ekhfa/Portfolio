## Project Overview

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This project involves the classification of iris flowers using the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. KNN is trained on the training dataset, and the accuracy of the model is calculated on the test set, providing insight into its predictive performance.
