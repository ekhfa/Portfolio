## Project Overview

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
DocTalk is an Android app designed to facilitate easy access to medical consultations, particularly during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic. It acts as a platform connecting users with certified doctors, allowing them to receive medical advice, prescriptions, and access to prescribed medications from reputable online stores. The app also provides online resources based on the doctor's recommendations, making it an interactive and comprehensive solution for users' medical needs. Key features include saving medical history, access to prescription details, guided exercise videos, and appointment notifications. The app is built using Android Studio and utilizes Firebase for its online database, Vision API for extracting text from prescriptions, Google Maps for drug source location, YouTube API for suggesting relevant videos. While particularly valuable during a pandemic, DocTalk is also suitable for day-to-day medical advice and support.
