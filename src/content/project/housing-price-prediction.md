## Project Overview

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This project involves the analysis and prediction of house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, and encode categorical variables. Feature scaling is performed to normalize the data. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets. Three regression algorithms—ElasticNet, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—are applied to predict house prices. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction, and a Decision Tree algorithm is applied on the reduced dataset. The project aims to compare the performance of these models in predicting house prices based on the given features.
